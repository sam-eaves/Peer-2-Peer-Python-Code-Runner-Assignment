# Peer 2 Peer Python Runner Assignment
Runs a local webserver which clients can connect to and view posted python jobs to complete.
A website updates periodically to show connected clients, clients connect to the webserver and query each different client looking for jobs.
If jobs are found, they connect to that client, retrieve the job, complete it and send the results back to that client.

Below are screenshots of the assignment.
